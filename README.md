# My blog articles

Hello, my name is Jan and I write blog articles from time to time. As I write them always in markdown on my PC anyways I thought that I could also collect and backup all articles in one place: This repo.

Feel free to read, critique or ignore any of the articles here. If you have feedback, you can either talk to me on [gitter](https://gitter.im/jvanbruegge) or you can open an issue.

If you find an error, you can keep it (or open a PR to fix it ;) ).
